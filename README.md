# Maze
I have dreamed a little about getting out of my web programming rutine and put a little algorithm on my shoulders. I was thinking about different projects, so I have chosen this maze generator. This project has a potential of future expansion, I did my best to write it with good architecture, to scale this project well and keep it simple.

I was and still am curious about this project. 

**Pros of this projects**
- maze build algorithm 
- reminds me power of OOP
- force me to think about strucutre 

**What's next?**
- camera system {moving around, zooming}
- small UI {some shortcuts, property settings}
- mouse class
  - adding player
  - adding food
- player 
  - move freely inside the maze
  - collect food
- start/finish
  - add start
  - add finish
- implement path finding algorithm
- connect all futures together expand ui
- slow {animated} maze build / path build
